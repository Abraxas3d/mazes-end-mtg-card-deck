Reproduced here as a backup. 

Turbo fog till you win. With 2 ways to win and a 3rd side board you keep your opponents on their toes. Broken Bond is a recent addition in the side board to deal with blood moon and other pesky cards that may turn your engine off. The odd forest is insurance against blood moon. Mill and Blood moon are my worst matchups but not impossible to beat. Looking to improve it. Decided on Ancient Stirrings over Open the Gates due to more versatility of choice between land only or one of my artifacts.
