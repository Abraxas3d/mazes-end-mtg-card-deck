Reproduced here as a backup. 

Ok, Card by Card, lets start with the Core:

Lands: Should be pretty obvious; Maze's End wins you the game, the other lands enable it. Note the four basics for when Snapcaster/Prime Time gets Path to Exiled or your Gates get Ghost Quartered. ALSO note that Maze's End is NOT Legendary; You can have all four out and activate them all, allowing you to fetch up the four lands you need, winning you the game (In case you have multiples of some of the others out to supply the mana).

Expedition Map: A easier to remove Maze's End without the Win Condition. Note that this can also fetch Maze's End, should an opponent decide to get rid of them, and you don't have Crucible of Worlds out.

Crucible of Worlds: Yup. You can no longer blow up my lands. You CANNOT DENY ME MY WIN!

Amulet of Vigor: I don't know if you know this, but Gates come into play tapped, and that's annoying. Be less annoyed, have an Amulet of Vigor. Also worth noting that you could theoretically pop Maze's End in response to a spell being played, tutor up the appropriate land and cast a counterspell/fog.

Primeval Titan: Let's not lie here; for the most part this guy is going to be nothing more than a double Maze's End trigger; pay 6, get two gates, put them into play. However, if for some reason you are able to untap with him, you will then be in Value Town, getting a further two gates for your win condition.

Kiora, the Crashing Wave: Don't even look at her ultimate. She will either enter the battlefield and stop a creature from punching you in the face, or draw you a card and let you play another gate. Either way she's eating a bolt/Goyf for you on the opponents turn (or before). Either keeps them from punching you in the face.

Summer's Bloom/Urban Evolution: Both allow us to play extra lands, getting us to that crucial 11 land count ever so quickly (1 of each gate and then Maze's End). Urban Evolution also allows us to draw more, so that is why we allow it despite it being so expensive. Keep in mind that with Amulet of Vigor out, Summer's Bloom taps two lands and puts three untapped gates out.

Snapcaster Mage/Remand/Silence: Pretty standard control cards; Remand and Silence stop spells from being cast (Which I'm told is a good thing), and Snapcaster lets you do it again (Which has the same things said about it).

In the Main Deck, I have your Combo Counter cards:

Inquisition of Kozilek/Thoughtseize: These rip the combo piece out of the opponents hand, allowing you to spare yourself from that headache. Inquisition is ok to keep against Aggro, but definitely side out Thoughtseize.

Swerve: Sometimes people play cards that can't be countered. Sometimes people want to Path your Prime Time instead of their own Goyf, or your now useless Snapcaster. This spell is to show them they are wrong. Keep in mind that just because a spell can't be countered, doesn't mean it can't be Swerved. Also keep in mind that it can counter counterspells, simply because it Swerves the target to Swerve itself, which causes it to fizzle since Swerve is no longer on the stack when it resolves.

Rune Snag: Early game, it's a bad Mana Leak, late game it's even better than Counterspell; no one is going to pay 6 for any spell, especially if they have plans after.

And now for the Creatures:

Fog/Holy Day/Candles' Glow: All here to keep Aggro decks at bay. Fog and Holy day can keep any creature attack at bay, where as Candle's Glow can prevent a total 6 damage. Worst comes to worst, you can Candles' Glow to stop two Lightning Bolts from getting through; one card for two is never that bad. Also keep in mind that these stop Bogle, while normal creature removal doesn't.

Lightning Bolt/Path to Exile: There are creatures that just need to be gone. Here is your way of getting them gone. While niche in effect, Swerve can change the target if the original target becomes illegal (But note that it can't change the target from a Legal to Illegal one).

Comment

Absolutely requires a God Hand, but you are fully capable of winning turn 4 with this deck:

[Basic Land, Amulet of Vigor, 1st Green Guildgate, 2nd Green Guildgate, 3rd Guildgate, Primeval Titan, Summer's Bloom]

T1: Draw 4th Gate, play Basic, Play Amulet.
T2: Draw 5th Gate, Play Green Gate, Summer's Bloom, play 3 Gates.
T3: Draw, Gate, Primeval Titan, fetch 7th Gate + Maze's End.
T4, Draw, Attack, feth 8th and 9th Gate, Maze's End into 10th Gate and win.

Mind you, that involves not having anything countered, so it's not going to happen too often. I wouldn't even try to attempt it due to how easy it is to disrupt, but it's there if you can manage or are willing to risk it.
